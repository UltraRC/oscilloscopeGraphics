TODO:
- Writing code which plots an arbutrary number of shapes, one afer the other
- Could send pointer to a shape, so that it can still be modified
- Need to find a way to dynamically change which shapes are being rendered


- Determine maximum rate of DAC output
    o How fast can the DAC change from one voltage to another
- Determine minium point spacing/density to generate a convincing line
- From the above determine maximum speed.
- Determine maximum number of points that can be sent to the DAC in a single
  frame.




What are we trying to achieve?
- Draw shapes onto the screen of an analog osciloscope in XY mode by
  moving the beam quickely between points.
- The most fundamental shape that can be drawn is a line, all other 
  shapes will be composed of lines.
    o A line is drawn by quickely moving the beam to a series of 
      evenly spaced points which span the distance from the start
      of the line to the end.
    o The drawing of a line has several parameters:
        1) Starting coordinate. (XY)
        2) Ending coordinate.   (XY)
        3) Line point density ==> Density of points between the starting and 
           ending point of the line.
        4) Beam speed. ==> Units of pixles/second or points/second
