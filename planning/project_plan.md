# 1 - Project Description and Motivation
A video I viewed on the internet a while ago featured a series of games that were programmed to be played using an oscilloscope. A pair of voltages generated by a micro-controller were connected to two inputs of an old CRT oscilloscope set to XY mode. In this mode the two voltages control the position of the X and Y axes respectively. An interesting asthetic with respect to the games graphics was achieved when drawn on an old analog CRT oscilloscope, and it inspired me do a project based on the consept.

Making a game, simple or otherwise is generally accepted as the most desirable outcome of this project; however, ability to easily draw arbutrary graphics to an oscilliscope would suffice as a minimum achivement to reach.

## 1.1 - How is an Oscilloscope used to Draw Shapes?
Currently, to draw graphics to the oscilliscope a series of points needs to be defined and then itterated over in quick succession to create the illusion of a continuousely drawn shape rather than a colleciton of discrete points. The continutity of the shapes stems from the tendancy of light to persist for a short time after the electron beam has passed a particular spot on CRT monitors. 

Given the above characteristics of the displays on older CRT oscilloscopes, I shall begin by stating that the fundamental shape that can be drawn on such a shape is a line with a starting coordinate and an ending coordinate. A line is drawn by quickely moving the beam to a series of evenly spaced points which span the distance from the start of the line to the end. The density of points along the line and the speed of beam movement are both important paramaters which will influence the drawing of the shape.

To draw one line, the following parameters must be known:
1. Starting coordinate (XY)
2. Ending coordinate (XY)
3. Point density --> The density of points between the start of the line and the end
4. Beam speed --> Rate at which the electron beam travels along the line

# Beam Speed and Point Density
Light does not persist very much if at all in the path that the electron beam takes between two points; this is likely due to the near instantaneous rate at which the beam is able to shift one position to the next.
Therefore, the electron beam must instead itterate over a series of closely spaced points to create the illusion of a line.

Point density is an important metric for drawing shapes, it defines the number of points that the electron beam moves to within a certain distance. If the point density is too low then the shape we are trying to draw will simply appear as a line of dots in a row. The density must be increased to a point where the points appear to produce a continusous line (or close enough). We cannot increase the point density too heavily however, as we are limited by the rate at which the hardware can change its output voltages which are used to tell the oscilloscope where to position its electron beam.

The rate at which the hardware can change the voltage being sent to the oscilliscope
